From the video and implementation, I gained a deep understanding of linked lists, their structure, and practical applications. A linked list is made up of nodes, each containing data and a pointer. The data holds the value, while the pointer references the next node. The last node's pointer is null, marking the end. This setup allows linked lists to grow or shrink dynamically.
Linked lists and ArrayLists have key differences. Linked lists are better for frequent insertions and deletions, performing these operations in constant time (O(1)) at the beginning or end, or with direct node references. In contrast, ArrayLists require shifting elements, making these operations linear in time complexity (O(n)). Accessing elements in a linked list is slower (O(n)), as it requires traversing from the start, whereas ArrayLists allow constant time (O(1)) access using indices. Memory usage also differs: linked lists use more memory for pointers, while ArrayLists use contiguous blocks, making them more memory-efficient.
Implementing a linked list posed challenges, such as managing pointers to maintain structure during insertions and deletions. Efficient memory management was crucial to prevent leaks, and handling edge cases, like adding or removing nodes at the beginning or end, required careful consideration.
Linked lists are ideal for dynamic data structures where frequent modifications are needed, like online shopping carts or library databases. They support specialized algorithms requiring dynamic data insertion and deletion. For instance, in a scheduling app, linked lists enable efficient task management and real-time updates without the overhead of resizing or reorganizing fixed-size arrays.

In summary, linked lists are flexible and efficient for managing dynamic data, making them invaluable for various programming projects.
